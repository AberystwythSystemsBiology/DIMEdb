# DIMEdb: Direct Infusion Metabolite Database

<a href="http://dimedb.ibers.aber.ac.uk"><img src="http://svgshare.com/i/2XL.svg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="6"></a>

The **Direct Infusion MEtabolite database** (or **DIMEdb**), which provides an accessible interface for both programmatic
and user access to an integrated metabolomic database - sourced from multiple existing metabolomic and chemical databases.
We hope that this service will be exploited by software developers to build or extend bioinformatic tools for analysis and
integration of metabolomic experimentation, whilst additionally streamlining the manual metabolite searching process for
non-developers. DIMEdb is freely available at [http://dimedb.ibers.aber.ac.uk]
